# PORPOISE Network

Proof of Reputation Protocol for Outsourced Intuition Sampling Ensembles (PORPOISE) seeks to provide an open protocol for the creation of digital identities that are cryptographically bound to a sequence of concealed predictions about future events. A participantâ€™s predictions can be selectively revealed at a later date or overall prediction accuracy can be attested without disclosing specific event choices. 

Predictions are made at verifiable times in regards to specific publicly posed questions (referred to as *surveys*) about future events. The final resolution of the event is also publicly verifiable (e.g. the winner of a local election, or the victor in a sporting event) and committed to the blockchain via oracles prespecified in the survey. Lastly, crowd-sourced predictions can effectively be purchased from survey participants through the use of bounties tied to the survey on the blockchain.
