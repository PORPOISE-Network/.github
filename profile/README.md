# PORPOISE Network

Proof of Reputation Protocol for Outsourced Intuition Sampling Ensembles (PORPOISE) seeks to provide an open protocol for the creation of digital identities that are cryptographically bound to a sequence of concealed predictions about future events. A participant’s predictions can be selectively revealed at a later date or overall prediction accuracy can be attested without disclosing specific event choices. 

Predictions are made at verifiable times in regards to specific, publicly posed questions about future events, referred to in this work as “surveys”. The final resolution of the event is also publicly verifiable (e.g. the winner of a local election, or the victor in a sporting event) and committed to the blockchain via prespecified oracles. Lastly, crowd-sourced predictions can effectively be purchased from survey participants through the use of bounties tied to the survey on the blockchain.
